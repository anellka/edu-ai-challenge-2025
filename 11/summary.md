## Summary

Summary:

A 25-year-old healthy male patient presented with sharp chest pain localized over the heart area, lasting a few seconds at a time, and persisting for about three days. The pain is worse when coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 and sometimes experiences radiation to his neck. He denies shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, numbness, fever, or other systemic symptoms. He recently recovered from the flu one week prior. He has no significant past medical history, no medications except occasional Tylenol, no allergies, and no prior surgeries. 

Notably, his father suffered a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, which has increased the patient's anxiety about his symptoms. The patient is a student studying engineering, works part-time as a postman, lives with his mother, drinks alcohol occasionally, and denies smoking or recreational drug use.

The healthcare provider acknowledged the patient's concerns, expressed empathy regarding his father's recent death, and planned to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart function. The patient was advised not to worry excessively until test results are available, and further management will be based on findings.
