**[0:00]**: What brings you here today?

**[0:02]**: I'm just having this really sharp pain in my chest and I'm scared. I think I'm having a heart attack.

**[0:10]**: Oh wow, that must be really scary.

**[0:15]**: Yeah.

**[0:16]**: When did this pain start?

**[0:19]**: It started about three days ago.

**[0:22]**: Three days ago? Okay.

**[0:25]**: And where exactly in your chest do you feel it?

**[0:30]**: It's kind of right here, right over my heart, I think. That's where it's the worst.

**[0:36]**: Okay. And what kind of pain is it? Is it more like a dull pressure pain or is it a sharp pain? How would you describe it?

**[0:47]**: I'd say it's a sharp pain.

**[0:50]**: A sharp pain? Okay.

**[0:53]**: And so it started three days ago. Has it been coming and going or has it been constant?

**[1:02]**: It just lasts for a few seconds and then it goes away.

**[1:07]**: Okay. And does the pain come on when you're doing any activities or when does the pain usually come on?

**[1:17]**: It's usually worse when I'm coughing or I'm lying down. Yeah.

**[1:25]**: Okay. And does it improve with any positional changes at all or anything that you do, does it help?

**[1:34]**: When I lean forward it actually does get better if I think about it, yeah.

**[1:41]**: Okay. And has this ever happened to you before?

**[1:46]**: No, no it hasn't.

**[1:50]**: Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least amount of pain you felt and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it?

**[1:59]**: I'd say a 6 out of 10.

**[2:02]**: Okay. And does the pain move anywhere in your chest or does it stay in the same spot?

**[2:10]**: Yeah, I think it kind of goes to my neck sometimes.

**[2:14]**: Okay. And do you have any other symptoms like do you have any shortness of breath, dizziness, anything like that?

**[2:22]**: No, I don't.

**[2:24]**: Okay. Any palpitations?

**[2:27]**: Nope.

**[2:29]**: Okay. And other than that, have you been having any other symptoms at all besides the pain?

**[2:38]**: No, nothing else. I just have these short episodes of pain that last a couple of seconds.

**[2:45]**: Okay. Have you tried any medications that have helped the pain?

**[2:52]**: Yeah, I took some Tylenol and that did help.

**[2:58]**: Okay.

**[2:59]**: I took it once yesterday.

**[3:01]**: Alright. Any recent injuries to the area, like do you have any falls or anything like that?

**[3:09]**: No, no I haven't.

**[3:13]**: Okay. Any headaches, nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills, any of those symptoms?

**[3:20]**: Nope.

**[3:22]**: Okay. Any cough, runny nose, any viral symptoms?

**[3:30]**: Well, not right now, but I did have a flu last week. I had a fever, I had a runny nose.

**[3:43]**: I did have a bit of a cough and I was feeling super tired, but not anymore. I'm okay now.

**[3:50]**: Okay. And have you at all had any dizziness or have you fainted at all?

**[3:58]**: Nope.

**[3:59]**: Okay. Have you been noticing any kind of weakness or numbness?

**[4:07]**: Nope.

**[4:09]**: Nope. Okay. In terms of your past medical history, do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, any other diagnoses?

**[4:21]**: No, I'm a pretty healthy 25-year-old.

**[4:25]**: Okay. And do you take any medications?

**[4:29]**: I sometimes take Tylenol.

**[4:32]**: Okay. And any allergies at all?

**[4:36]**: Nope.

**[4:38]**: Okay. And any previous surgeries?

**[4:47]**: No, no, no surgeries.

**[4:50]**: Do you have any family history of any heart conditions or any cancers or anything like that?

**[4:56]**: Yeah. My father, he had a heart attack two weeks ago and he passed away. And I'm worried I'm having a heart attack too.

**[5:10]**: It was just two weeks ago?

**[5:12]**: Yeah.

**[5:14]**: I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be a really difficult time for you right now.

**[5:21]**: Mm-hmm.

**[5:23]**: Okay. So you're worried you might be having a heart attack as well?

**[5:27]**: Yeah.

**[5:28]**: Okay. So we can definitely do some tests and see what's going on.

**[5:36]**: I just have a few more questions and then I'll just get to some of the management and what we'll be doing for you in the future.

**[5:45]**: So currently right now, do you work at all?

**[5:50]**: No, I'm a student. Well, as a part-time job, I do work as a postman.

**[5:58]**: Okay. And where are you a student? What do you do?

**[6:03]**: I'm studying engineering at Western.

**[6:07]**: All right. And currently, where do you live? Do you live in a student housing, apartment or home or house?

**[6:15]**: I live with my parents. Well, my mom now. In a house.

**[6:23]**: All right. And do you drink at all alcohol?

**[6:28]**: I drink occasionally. Maybe one or two drinks on the weekends.

**[6:33]**: Okay. And any recreational drug use like marijuana or cocaine?

**[6:38]**: No.

**[6:41]**: And do you smoke?

**[6:42]**: No.

**[6:47]**: All right. So those are all the questions we had for you today.

**[6:51]**: It must be really difficult and scary for you right now.

**[6:55]**: But we'll make sure to get to the bottom of this, see what's going on.

**[6:59]**: So what we can do is get you an ECG to see how your heart is functioning and then see, get any blood work if we need it for the future.

**[7:14]**: Yeah. Right now, I would say try not to worry too much about it right now and see what some of those tests come back.

**[7:24]**: Thank you.

**[7:26]**: So, yeah, you're welcome.
