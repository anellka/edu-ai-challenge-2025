  Chain of Thought:
•	Both samples mention features and issues specific to a high-end mouse, and the context (dongle, 8000Hz, price) matches the Razer Viper V3 PRO, so both are relevant.
•	Sample 1 details technical and hardware issues, with a negative sentiment and actionable improvement suggestions.
•	Sample 2 praises the product's quality but criticizes its price-to-value ratio, resulting in a mixed sentiment. The user demonstrates familiarity with mouse performance and specs, indicating experience.
