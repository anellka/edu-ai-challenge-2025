## üìã Supported Search Criteria

The tool can intelligently extract and apply the following criteria from natural language:

- **Category**: Electronics, Fitness, Kitchen, Books, Clothing
- **Price Range**: Maximum price limits (e.g., "under $100", "less than $500")
- **Rating**: Minimum rating requirements (e.g., "highly rated", "above 4.5 stars")
- **Stock Status**: In-stock vs out-of-stock filtering
- **Keywords**: Product-specific features and attributes

## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14.0.0 or higher)
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd 10
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
     cp env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```

## üîß Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini    # AI model to use (default)
```

### Available Models
- `gpt-4.1-mini` (default, optimized for function calling)
- `whisper-1` (for speech-to-text, not used in this application)

## üöÄ Usage

### Interactive Mode

```bash
npm start
# or
node index.js
```

The application will prompt you to enter your search preferences in natural language.

### Command Line Help

```bash
npm run help
# or
node index.js --help
```

## üìù Example Search Queries

- Original query
- Extracted criteria (category, price, rating, keywords)
- Number of products found

### Product List
```
Filtered Products:
1. Wireless Headphones - $99.99, Rating: 4.5, In Stock
2. Smart Watch - $199.99, Rating: 4.6, In Stock
3. Bluetooth Speaker - $49.99, Rating: 4.4, In Stock
```

Each product shows:
- Name
- Price
- Rating
- Stock status (In Stock/Out of Stock)

## üèó Technical Architecture

### OpenAI Function Calling
The application uses OpenAI's function calling feature to:
1. Parse natural language preferences
2. Extract structured search criteria
3. Apply intelligent filtering logic
4. Return formatted results

### Function Definition
```javascript
{
  name: 'filter_products',
  description: 'Filter products based on user preferences and criteria',
  parameters: {
    // Structured schema for product filtering
    filtered_products: [...],
    criteria_used: { category, max_price, min_rating, ... }
  }
}
```

### Data Structure
Products are stored in `products.json` with the following schema:
```json
{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "category": "Category",
  "price": 99.99,
  "rating": 4.5,
  "in_stock": true
}
```

## üîç How It Works

1. **User Input**: Application accepts natural language query
2. **API Call**: Sends query and product database to OpenAI
3. **Function Calling**: AI uses defined function to filter products
4. **Processing**: Extracts criteria and applies intelligent matching
5. **Output**: Returns structured list of matching products

## üîí Security & Privacy

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- No user data is stored or logged
- All processing happens through OpenAI's secure API
- Product data remains local in `products.json`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing API Key Error**
   ```
   ‚ùå Error: OpenAI API key not found!
   ```
   - Ensure `.env` file exists with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`

2. **Function Calling Errors**
   ```
   OpenAI API Error: Function call not executed properly
   ```
   - Check if your API key has function calling access
   - Try using `gpt-4.1-mini` model

3. **Products Loading Error**
   ```
   ‚ùå Error loading products.json
   ```
   - Ensure `products.json` exists in the same directory
   - Check file permissions and JSON syntax

### Dependencies Issues

If you encounter installation issues:

```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **Model Selection**: `gpt-4.1-mini` provides excellent results for function calling with good performance
2. **Query Clarity**: More specific queries yield better results
3. **API Limits**: Be aware of OpenAI rate limits for high-volume usage

## üéØ Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **E-commerce Applications**: Product recommendation systems
- **Inventory Management**: Natural language inventory search
- **Customer Service**: Automated product assistance
- **Market Research**: Product analysis and filtering
- **Personal Shopping**: Finding products based on preferences
