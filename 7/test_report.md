**Coverage**: 100% - Complete board functionality validation

### 4. AI Strategy Tests ✅ (7/7 passed)

**Purpose**: Validates artificial intelligence behavior and decision making

#### RandomAIStrategy (2/2 passed)
| Test Case | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Make valid guesses | ✅ PASS | Coordinate validation |
| Not repeat guesses | ✅ PASS | Duplicate avoidance |

#### SmartAIStrategy (5/5 passed)
| Test Case | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Start in hunt mode | ✅ PASS | Initial AI state |
| Switch to target mode after hit | ✅ PASS | Strategic mode switching |
| Return to hunt mode after sinking | ✅ PASS | Mode reset after ship destruction |
| Add adjacent cells to target queue | ✅ PASS | Strategic targeting logic |
| Make guesses from target queue | ✅ PASS | Target mode execution |

**Coverage**: 100% - Both AI strategies fully validated

### 5. Event System Tests ✅ (3/3 passed)

**Purpose**: Validates event-driven architecture and observer pattern

| Test Case | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Register event listeners | ✅ PASS | Event subscription |
| Pass data to event listeners | ✅ PASS | Data transmission |
| Handle multiple listeners for same event | ✅ PASS | Multiple subscriber support |

**Coverage**: 100% - Event system fully tested

### 6. Game State Tests ✅ (3/3 passed)

**Purpose**: Validates state machine and input handling

| Test Case | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Handle valid input in playing state | ✅ PASS | Valid input processing |
| **Reject invalid input in playing state** | ✅ **PASS** | **Invalid input rejection** |
| Always reject input in game ended state | ✅ PASS | End state behavior |

**✅ FIXED ISSUE**:
- **Previous Issue**: Test incorrectly expected coordinate "99" to be invalid
- **Root Cause**: Coordinate (9,9) is valid for a 10x10 board (0-9 range)
- **Resolution**: Changed test to use empty string input which is properly invalid
- **Impact**: Test now correctly validates input validation logic
